This project attempts to de-anonymize data from the Netflix Prize dataset, using the [MovieLens 20M dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/) as auxiliary information.

The attack follows the approach proposed by this paper : [Robust De-anonymization of Large Sparse Datasets](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_oak08netflix.pdf)
