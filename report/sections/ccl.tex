\section{Conclusion}

The famous Netflix attack was reproduced on a subset of the Netflix and the MovieLens datasets. Several matches with an eccentricity higher than FILL were found, which are lower values than was found in the original attack. 

To validate the method, a fake entry was added in both datasets and the corresponding eccentricity was FILL.
